/* ==============================================================
   EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO ONE ACCOUNT

   Called on every auth transition, in both directions — not only when
   someone presses Sign Out.

   That distinction is the whole bug this exists for. The caches were
   cleared in handleSignOut() and nowhere else, so a sign-in that
   followed any *other* kind of session ending — a lapsed token, which
   onAuthStateChange handles by quietly showing the login screen —
   started with the previous account's rows still in memory and served
   them. A fresh sign-up was the worst case, because a new account has
   no disk snapshot, so showApp()'s `if(warm)` skipped the revalidate
   that would eventually have corrected it.

   js/api.js now refuses to hand its cache to a user it was not filled
   for, which is the backstop and the thing that makes this
   structurally safe. This is the belt to that pair of braces: it
   clears the per-account state living in the other files, which the
   cache guard cannot see.

   Two things it deliberately leaves alone:

   - **The disk snapshot.** It is keyed by user id already (snapKey in
     offline.js), so it cannot leak across accounts, and a session
     lapsing in a tunnel is not a reason to destroy someone's offline
     copy of their own data. Explicit sign-out still clears it.
   - **The schema probes** (remind_at, the media bucket) are facts
     about the database, identical for everyone, so re-probing them
     per account would be a round trip for a known answer.
     probeSharing() is reset anyway because _sharedIds beside it is
     per-user, and separating them is not worth one cheap query.

/* ==============================================================
   IS THIS SESSION STILL A REAL ACCOUNT?

   It shipped that it did not have to be. Deleting an account signs out
   the device that pressed the button and nothing else — and there is
   always something else: another browser, a laptop, and on iOS the
   installed PWA, which has its own storage partition and is therefore
   a second signed-in copy of the app by construction.

   Every one of those keeps a session in localStorage, and nothing ever
   asked the server about it:

   - getSession() answers from disk without a request whenever the
     access token has not expired, so restoreSession() saw a perfectly
     good session for an account that no longer existed;
   - PostgREST verifies a JWT's *signature*. It does not check that
     auth.uid() still exists in auth.users, so the token kept being
     accepted — reads came back empty, because the rows had cascaded
     away, which is exactly what an account with nothing in it looks
     like.

   The result was being signed into a deleted account for the lifetime
   of an access token, seeing an empty app, and — the way this was
   found — following an invite link into it. Everything downstream then
   failed in a way that pointed anywhere but here: join_collection()
   inserts a member row with a foreign key onto auth.users, so it was
   rejected for a reason no message on screen could explain.

   So the session is checked against the server once per launch.
   getUser() is a real request to /auth/v1/user, which 4xxs for a user
   that has been deleted or banned.

   TWO RULES, and the second is the one that keeps this from becoming a
   worse bug than the one it fixes:

   1. It never blocks the first paint. The check is started at boot and
      awaited only by the things that must not run against a dead
      session — joining a list, redeeming a claimed invite.
   2. **Only a definitive answer from the server signs anyone out.** A
      request that failed to arrive is not an answer. Offline, or on a
      flaky connection, the session is kept — signing someone out
      because their train went into a tunnel is the bug restoreSession()
      already exists to avoid, and it would be worse arriving from here.

   CONFIRMING AN EMAIL ADDRESS

   This project has email confirmation switched on, so an account does
   not exist usefully until its owner has come back through a link in
   their inbox. That round trip leaves the app entirely — through a mail
   client, quite often onto a different device — and everything it has
   to survive happens somewhere this code does not run. So, like
   accepting an invite, it is built with a floor under it rather than
   one happy path.

   THE LINK ITSELF IS CONFIGURED IN THE DASHBOARD, NOT HERE. Two
   settings, and getting either wrong looks identical from the outside
   ("I clicked the link and it opened a broken page"):

   - **Authentication → URL Configuration → Site URL** is where every
     confirmation link goes. Left at the Supabase default it is
     http://localhost:3000, so every recipient lands on a dead page.
     emailRedirectTo below does *not* override this on its own —
     Supabase silently ignores a redirect that is not allow-listed and
     falls back to Site URL, which is exactly how this failure hides.
   - **Redirect URLs** must therefore contain the app's real origin
     before emailRedirectTo has any effect at all.

   - **Authentication → Emails → Confirm signup** should point at
     token_hash rather than the default ConfirmationURL:

         {{ .SiteURL }}/index.html?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email

     That is what makes the link work on a *different device from the
     one that signed up*, which is the common case: people sign up on a
     laptop and read their mail on a phone. The default link comes back
     as ?code=… and, because this client uses PKCE, redeeming it needs
     the code verifier that signUp() wrote to localStorage in the
     original browser. On any other device that exchange fails with
     "both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty" and the
     recipient lands on the sign-in screen having apparently done
     nothing. verifyOtp() carries no such requirement.

   The ?code= path is still handled below, because links already sent
   are still in people's inboxes, and because password recovery uses the
   same machinery.

   hourly allowance on Supabase's built-in email service, which is a
   testing facility with a very small budget. Shown verbatim it reads
   as "you have done something wrong", when the truthful version is

   RESETTING A PASSWORD

   Until this existed, a forgotten password was total account loss:
   there was no way to ask for a link and no screen to set a new one.

   It is deliberately built out of the machinery already here rather
   than beside it, because it is the *same* round trip as confirming an
   address — out of the app, through a mail client, very often onto a
   different device, and back. So it inherits every floor that section
   put under that trip: the same reader, the same verifyOtp(), the same
   failure notice, the same per-address cooldown, the same rate-limit
   wording.

   THE TEMPLATE IS CONFIGURED IN THE DASHBOARD, exactly like the
   confirmation one, and getting it wrong fails the same silent way:

       Authentication → Emails → Reset password

       {{ .SiteURL }}/index.html?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=recovery

   That is what makes a reset link work on a device other than the one
   that asked for it — which here is the *normal* case, because someone
   who cannot get in on their phone will very often go and ask from a
   laptop. The default {{ .ConfirmationURL }} comes back as ?code=, and
   with PKCE that exchange needs the verifier written to localStorage in
   the browser that made the request; anywhere else it fails with "both
   auth code and code verifier should be non-empty".

   It also carries `type=recovery`, which is the only thing that tells
   this client the landing is a reset rather than a confirmation. On the
   ?code= path there is nothing in the URL that says so, so such a link
   signs the person in and drops them in the app with their old password
   unchanged — recoverable (they can ask again from a browser that
   works) but not what they asked for. One more reason to set the
   template.

   Where the person lands is the last step of the reset, not a gate in
   front of the app: verifyOtp() has already established a session by
   the time the panel is drawn, so a reload from there simply goes in.
   That is the escape hatch, and it is why there is no "skip" button to
   explain.
