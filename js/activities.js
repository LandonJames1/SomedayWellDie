   ACTIVITIES — the add / complete / edit / delete flows.

   Two speeds, deliberately:
     - Quick:  type a name in the composer and press return;

     - Full:   the activity sheet, for when details matter.

/* The composer is a way to START an activity, not a way to file one.

   Nothing anywhere in the app inserts an activity without showing this
   sheet first. That is a deliberate reversal: the composer used to
   insert on Return with only a name, which was the fastest path in the
   app and also the one that produced its worst rows — no priority, no
   real target date, no location, so the thing never surfaced in Up Next
   and never appeared on the map. An idea captured into a hole is not
   captured.

   Nothing on the sheet is required beyond the name, so this still costs
   one extra tap (Save) rather than any actual filling-in — but the
   fields are in front of the user at the one moment they are thinking
   about the thing, which is the only moment they will ever bother.

   The duplicate check lives in saveActivity(), so there is none here —
   checking twice would ask the same question on the way in and on the

   ONE QUESTION BEFORE THE SHEET

   An activity arrives two ways round: something you mean to do, and
   something you have just done and want on the record. The second had
   no path at all — you had to create the plan and immediately complete
   it, which is two sheets and a fiction in between. A helicopter ride
   taken on a whim is exactly the thing this app is for, and it was the
   thing it was worst at.

   So every *human* way in asks first. Deliberately not inside
   openNewActivity() itself: a link import (handOffSingle) and the bulk
   sheet land there too, and both are plans by construction, so the
   question would have only one answer.

   New Activity is first because it is the overwhelmingly common
   answer, and this costs the fast path a tap — the composers were
   tuned so capture costs one extra tap and it is now two. Keeping the
   common answer under the thumb is what makes that bearable.

   COMPLETING SOMETHING

   One sheet does the whole job, and every field is on it: the name,
   the date, where it happened, the photos and video, and how it went.

   It used to be two sheets. A date-only sheet completed the activity,
   and attaching anything to it meant closing that, reopening the
   activity, and finding "Add photos & notes" three taps down. The
   moment you have the photos is the moment you tick the thing off, so
   they belong in the same sheet.

   The photos and notes then spent a while behind a disclosure on this
   sheet, which was the same mistake one level in — the collapsed half
   held the single thing people most want to attach, and a collapsed
   field is one most people never open. It is all on screen now. That
   costs the two-tap flow nothing: check, then Done, still works
   without touching anything in between.

   Nothing is written until Save, so an accidental tap still costs a
   Cancel rather than a wrong date to find later.
