   NOTES — the append-only log on an activity.

   ---- Why notes came back, and why they came back different ----

   The activity sheet used to carry a "Notes / Why is this on your
   list?" field, and it was removed for a good reason that still
   holds: at the moment of capture, the answer to "why is this on
   your list" is the activity's name. The field sat empty on nearly
   every row while costing the sheet a block of height.

   This is not that field. Once a list is shared, notes are the
   working state of a plan several people are making — "we settled on
   the 14th", "Sarah's booking the car", "the permit window opens in
   March". That is a collaboration artifact, not a capture-time one,
   and it is written *after* the activity exists rather than while it
   is being created.

   ---- Append-only, and that is the whole design ----

   The app is last-write-wins with no presence, which is fine for a
   library one person curates and exactly wrong for a field two
   people might edit during one conversation. A single text column
   would mean one of them silently losing what they wrote.

   So a note is a row: attributed, timestamped, and never rewritten.
   Two people adding at the same moment both succeed, because they
   are not writing to the same place. There is deliberately no UPDATE
   policy on the table — an entry is what somebody said at a moment,
   and a log whose history can be edited is not a log. A wrong entry
   is removed and another added.

   ---- Removing one ----

   The author can remove their own; the owner of the list the
   activity is homed in can remove any, which is the moderation floor
   a shared space needs. That is enforced by RLS — the checks here
   only decide which buttons to draw.

   ---- It rides on messages.sql ----

   activity_notes is created by the same migration as the messages
   tables, so notesReady() is messagesReady(). Without it the notes
   section simply does not appear, exactly as the reminder UI does
   not appear without remind_at.

/* ⚠️ THE SYNCHRONOUS ANSWER IS WRONG ON A COLD START, and it fails in
   the most confusing possible way: probeMessages() is fired un-awaited
   at sign-in, so for the first moments of a session notesReady() says
   false, the activity sheet is built without its Notes tab, and it stays
   that way until the sheet is reopened. From the outside the log "only
   shows up sometimes".

   probeMessages() is a shared promise that short-circuits to a resolved
   one the instant it has an answer, so awaiting it costs a microtask on
   every open after the first. openConversation() already does this; the
   activity sheet did not. */
