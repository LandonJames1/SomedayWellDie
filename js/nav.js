   THE NATIVE HALF OF THE SCROLL LOCK

   THAT to keep the caret visible — which drags the whole page,
   including anything `position: fixed`, and is why an open sheet
   appeared to lift off the bottom of the screen and why the list
   behind it could still be scrolled through the gap.

   @capacitor/keyboard's setScroll pins that scroll view's offset at
   zero, which is the only thing that actually stops it. It is applied
   HERE rather than at boot because it disables the app's own page
   scrolling too — which is exactly what is wanted while a sheet is
   open and exactly what is not wanted the rest of the time. Sheet
   bodies are ordinary overflow scrollers inside the page, so they are

/* ==============================================================
   THE KEYBOARD AND THE TAB BAR

   .tabbar is `position: fixed; bottom: 0`. On iOS the software
   keyboard shrinks the **visual** viewport while leaving the layout
   viewport alone, and Safari re-anchors fixed elements to the visual
   one — so the tab bar climbs with the keyboard and parks on top of
   it, directly under the predictive-text row. It should stay at the
   bottom of the screen and let the keyboard cover it.

   Script cannot opt out of that re-anchoring, but it can measure it:
   the gap between the bottom of the visual viewport and the bottom of
   the layout viewport is exactly how far Safari has lifted the bar, so
   translating it back down by that amount returns it to where it
   belongs.

   Three things worth knowing:

   - **iOS only, and that is not a shortcut.** Chrome on Android keeps
     fixed elements pinned to the layout viewport already, which is the
     behaviour we are trying to produce. Applying the correction there
     as well would push the bar *below* the bottom of the screen by a
     whole keyboard's height.
   - **The tab bar and nothing else.** Bottom-anchored sheets are held
     in place by CSS instead — see THE KEYBOARD AND AN OPEN SHEET in
     modals.css. The conversation composer is *meant* to ride up and is
     handled in messages.js.
   - **translate3d, not translateY.** The bar carries
     `transform: translateZ(0)` in CSS to force its own layer, without
     which iOS repaints it late during momentum scrolling and it
     appears to drift. An inline transform overrides that, so it has to
     keep the promotion itself.

  if(!vv||!bar)return;
  /* Measured, not assumed. Clear the correction, ask where the bar

     no transform, so this needs no isIOS() guess — and it cannot be
