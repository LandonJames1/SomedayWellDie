   crypto.getRandomValues is NOT secure-context-gated, so the fallback

   SURVIVING A RELOAD

   Two things arrive in the query string and are read at boot — an
   invite to a shared list (?join=) and a link shared into the app
   (?share=). Both are stripped from the URL immediately, because the
   app has no router and a reload must not re-run them, and both are
   then held in an ordinary global until there is a signed-in user to
   hand them to.

   That last step is the fragile one: the stretch between boot and a
   signed-in user is exactly where a reload is most likely, since a
   recipient who has never opened the app has to sign in first. A
   reload at that point loses the global AND finds a URL with nothing
   left in it, so the capture is gone for good.

   sessionStorage is the right shelf for it — it survives a reload,
   it is scoped to the one tab, and it evaporates when that tab
   closes, so nothing can be re-run days later. Access is wrapped
   because it throws outright in some privacy modes.
   Reading deliberately does NOT remove: a capture is dropped when it
   is *consumed*, by the handler that finally has a user to hand it
   to, and not a moment earlier. Removing on read would mean surviving
   exactly one reload — enough for the service worker's, and not for
   someone who reloads again while still on the sign-in screen.

   THE SAME SHELF, BUT IT SURVIVES THE TAB CLOSING

   sessionStorage is scoped to one tab and dies with it, which is the
   right lifetime for a shared link and the WRONG one for an invite.

   The difference is what the recipient does next. A shared link lands
   on someone already signed in; an invite lands on someone who has to
   sign in first, and signing in is precisely when people leave the
   tab — to fetch the password out of a manager, to open the mail app
   for a confirmation, to find which email they used. iOS Safari
   discards background tabs aggressively under memory pressure, so
   coming back means a fresh tab, an empty sessionStorage, and a URL
   whose query string was stripped on the way in. The invite is gone,
   and the symptom is "the link just opens the app and does nothing".

   localStorage survives that. The property sessionStorage was giving
   for free — that nothing can be re-run days later — is replaced by
   an explicit stamp and TTL, which is the same guarantee written down
   rather than inherited.

     page load wide.

     sw.js calls skipWaiting() on install and clients.claim() on
     activate, so opening an invite link on a device that already had
     the app cached runs the OLD code first: it captured the code into
     sessionStorage and stripped the query string. The new worker then
     took control, pwa.js reloaded the page — correctly, this is a real
     update — and the NEW code looked for the code in localStorage,
     found nothing, and the invite was gone. No URL left to retry with
     and nothing on screen to say so.

     So a miss falls through to the old location and promotes what it

   MAKING A BAND HOLD STILL

   A band is a *relative* label and target_date is an *absolute* field,
   so storing the string was storing a promise that decays: "Next Year"
   picked in 2026 means 2027, and in 2027 it still rendered as "next
   year" — 2028 — quietly moving a deadline the user set once.

   The fix is not a nightly job that rewrites every row. It is to
   resolve the band the moment it is written and store the date it
   resolved to. targetBand() already buckets a real date into a label,
   so a row stored as 2027-12-31 *becomes* "This year" the instant 2027
   starts — on every device, with nothing scheduled and nothing to miss.

   "In 5+ Years" is deliberately NOT resolved. It names no deadline at
   all — it resolves to +5 only so it can be sorted and grouped, which
   is exactly why OPEN_BANDS refuses to count it down — so pinning it to
   a date would invent the fact the whole band exists to avoid stating.
   It stays a literal string forever.

   The visible cost, worth knowing before it is reported as a bug: the
   band you picked stops being the band you see. Choose "Next year" in
   December 2026, reopen it in January 2027, and it reads "This year".
   That is the feature. */

   SHOWING PRIORITY

   All three levels get the *same* treatment — a rail at the leading
   edge of the row and a capsule in the meta line — and differ only by
   hue:

     high    terracotta        --tint
     medium  saturated purple  --violet
     low     blue-teal         --slate

   They are three steps of one scale, so they have to look like it.
   Marking only some of them, or giving each a different shape, read as
   three unrelated things rather than a ranking.

   The lower two are separated on chroma as well as hue. They were a
   muted violet and a muted slate, which at capsule size read as the
   same colour twice — see the palette note in base.css.

   None of the three is red. Red is the deadline badge that sits beside
   them: an overdue activity and an important one are different claims
   on your attention, and sharing a colour made them argue.

   Completed activities show no priority at all — it is about what to
   do next, and a finished thing has no next.

   WRITING HTML WITHOUT REPAINTING WHAT DID NOT CHANGE

   Every screen in this app renders by assigning a template string to
   innerHTML, and nav() re-renders the destination on every visit. That
   is cheap for text and it is NOT cheap for anything the browser has
   to re-acquire: assigning innerHTML destroys every <img> in the block
   and creates new ones, so a cover photo is re-attached, re-decoded
   and (on a cold HTTP cache) re-fetched every single time you touch
   the tab. That is most of what "moving between pages reloads things"
   actually was.

   setHTML() compares against what is already there and does nothing
   when the markup is identical — which is the common case, because a
   re-render after navigation usually produces exactly the same string.
   The comparison is a string compare against the value we last wrote,
   held on the node, rather than reading innerHTML back (which
   serialises the whole subtree and would cost more than it saves).

   Use it for any block that contains images or is re-rendered on
   navigation. It is a drop-in for `el.innerHTML = html`.

   A STABLE FALLBACK COVER

   Collections without a cover image used to call randCover() at RENDER
   time, which picks at random — so the same list drew a different
   photo every time the Lists tab was rendered, and a collection's
   banner changed on every mutation. It read exactly like the app
   reloading things for no reason, because it was.

   The fallback is now derived from the collection's own id, so it is
   stable for the life of the row, identical on every screen that
   draws it, and identical across devices. randCover() is still what
   picks a cover when a collection is CREATED — a genuine one-off
   choice, and the one place randomness belongs.
