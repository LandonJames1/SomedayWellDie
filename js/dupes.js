/* ==============================================================
   DUPLICATE DETECTION

   The problem this app exists to solve is ideas scattered across
   Instagram saves, Notes and paper. Pulling all of that into one
   place necessarily drags the same idea in more than once — so the
   moment capture gets easy, duplicates become the next failure.

   Three rules shape everything here:

   1. **Nothing is ever deleted or merged automatically.** A match is
      a question, not a verdict. The user is shown what already
      exists and decides; "Add anyway" is the primary button, because
      the app being wrong must never cost more than one tap.
   2. **It must not slow capture down.** The check is synchronous
      against the in-memory row cache (api.js), so it costs nothing
      and works offline. If the cache is cold there is simply nothing
      to compare against and the add proceeds as before.
   3. **Matching is fuzzy, not exact.** "Skydive in Interlaken" and
      "Go skydiving in Interlaken" are the same plan written twice,
      and an exact-text check — which is what most apps ship — would
      catch neither that nor a typo. See js/fuzzy.js.

   ---- The thresholds ----

   Two bands, because the sheet should not make the same claim about
   a near-certain match and a faint one:

     DUPE_LIKELY    almost certainly the same thing
     DUPE_POSSIBLE  worth a look

   DUPE_POSSIBLE is set loose on purpose. There is a class of pair —
   one distinctive word shared inside a longer phrase — where no
   threshold can separate a true duplicate ("Eat at Noma" /
   "Dinner at Noma Copenhagen") from a false one ("Visit Paris" /
   "Paris Hilton documentary"); they score within a hundredth of each
   other. Given that, the tie goes to catching it: a false positive
   costs one tap, a missed duplicate is the exact problem the user
   came here to fix.

   SCORING

   activities called "Watch the sunrise" in different countries are
   not duplicates, and the place is the only thing that says so.

   THE GUARD

   The single entry point every add path goes through:

     dupeGuard({name, location, excludeId}, proceed)

   genuinely unchanged, not merely quick. With a match it opens the
   sheet and `proceed` becomes what "Add anyway" does.
