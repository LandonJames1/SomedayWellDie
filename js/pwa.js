   THE NATIVE APP IS NOT A THING YOU INSTALL

   Everything below this comment -- the install bar, the iOS
   Add-to-Home-Screen walkthrough, the row on the You tab -- exists to
   get a *browser tab* onto somebody's home screen. Inside the native
   shell that is already done, permanently, and offering it reads as
   the app not knowing where it is running.

   isNativeApp() is the gate. It is deliberately separate from
   isStandalone(): an installed PWA is standalone too, and there the
   install UI should also stay hidden -- but the native app is a
   different fact, checked against Capacitor's own global rather than
   inferred from a display mode. Keeping both means the WEB version's
   install prompts still work exactly as they did, which is the whole
   reason this was gated rather than deleted.

    /* ---- Reload when the worker CHANGES, never when it ARRIVES ----

       sw.js calls clients.claim() on activate, so on a first visit the
       page acquires a controller it never had — and this handler used
       to treat that exactly like an update and reload the app.

       That reload is worse than useless. The page is already running
       the newest code (it is the load that installed the worker), and
       the reload lands on a URL that boot has already stripped its
       query string from. readPendingJoin() holds
       what they captured in memory, so a shared list invite or a
       shared-in link opened by someone whose browser had never seen
       the app — which is every recipient, the first time — was silently
       destroyed before there was a signed-in user to hand it to. It
       presented as the invite link simply opening the normal app.

       The updatefound handler above already draws this distinction by
       checking for a controller before offering a reload; this is the
       same check, taken at parse time because by the time
       controllerchange fires the controller is non-null either way. */
