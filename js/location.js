   THE geo FUNCTION — HERE, without the key ever reaching a browser

   A domain-restricted client key is the normal answer here and it was
   deliberately rejected: nothing usable ships. So search goes
   browser → supabase/functions/geo → HERE, and the extra hop is real.
   Four things claw it back, and between them a typical search is
   faster than the single-hop version was, because most searches never
   leave the device at all:

   1. **A session cache, including the misses.** Typing is not a
      sequence of distinct queries — it is one query typed and
      re-typed. Backspacing a character, correcting a typo, opening a
      second activity in the same place: all free. This is the biggest
      win by a distance and it is why the debounce could stay where it
      is rather than being lengthened to compensate.
   2. **Prefix reuse on an empty answer.** If "jamba jui" returned
      nothing, "jamba juic" cannot return anything either — HERE's
      matching only narrows. So a longer query whose prefix came back
      empty is answered instantly, without a request.
   3. **A warm isolate.** warmGeo() at sign-in spins the function up
      and opens the TLS connection, so the first search of a session
      finds both already there. Cold, that is the slowest request the
      feature ever makes; warm, it is one of the fastest.
   4. **GET with Cache-Control**, so the browser's own HTTP cache
      absorbs anything the session cache misses — across reloads, and
      across the three sheets that each have their own field.

   And an AbortController, so a superseded request stops competing for
   the connection instead of racing to be ignored.

   ⚠️ IT WARMS WITH A REAL CALL THAT COSTS NOTHING — an empty name —

     - Type "Kyoto", press Save without tapping a suggestion, and the

     - Open an activity that HAS a location, change the text to

       stored against the OLD coordinates. A silently wrong pin, which
       is worse than no pin, because nothing about it looks wrong.

   So a text input carries `dataset.geoFor` — the exact string its

   A LOCATION IS REQUIRED

   Every activity needs one. The reasoning is the same one that pulled
   the field out of the old "More options" disclosure: an activity with
   no location never appears on the map, never appears in a place
   search, and the field was the one people skipped — so most
   activities silently never did.

   TWO THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:

   - **It does not block a save while offline.** Resolving text to
     coordinates needs the network, and refusing to save without it
     would break capture in exactly the place this app is meant to
     work — "ideas arrive on planes and in tunnels" is the whole
     argument for js/offline.js. Offline, typed text is accepted as-is
     and the activity syncs without coordinates.
   - **It does not apply to an activity that is already completed.**
     confirmComplete()'s edit pass is exempt for the same reason the
     media rule is (see updateMediaRequirement): enforcing a new
     requirement on the edit path strands every row created before it,
     whose owner then cannot fix a typo without first satisfying it.

   It DOES block an unresolvable place while online, which is the
   strict reading: a location that cannot be found is a location that
   will not be on the map, and accepting it silently is the failure
   this replaced. If that proves too strict in practice, returning
   `true` instead of `false` in the `!res.ok` branch below relaxes it

   GUESSING THE LOCATION FROM THE NAME

   An activity with no location never appears on the map, and the
   location field is the one people skip. The photo's EXIF answers this
   after the fact (see js/media.js); this answers it at the moment the
   activity is created, from the name alone.

   The model half is `{activity:{name}}` on the unfurl
   function — see the PREDICTING A LOCATION header there for why the
   bar is set where it is, and for the three gates it has to clear.
   This file holds the fourth, and the one that writes.

   Unlike the EXIF suggestion, an accepted answer here is **filled in,
   not offered**. That is a deliberate difference and it rests on the
   strictness: EXIF says "the camera was at these coordinates", which
   is often true of the poster, the screenshot or the drive there
   rather than the thing itself, so it has to be asked about. This says
   "the name of this activity is the name of this place", which is
   either right or the model should not have answered. What is filled
   in is marked, and one tap clears it.

   THE COST: one model call per activity created this way. Nothing
   caches across sessions, so retyping the same name pays again — the
   same gap the import path has.
   ============================================================== */

/* The predicted place has to share a real word with the activity name.

   This is the cheap backstop against an invented answer, and it is
   also the rule the whole feature is built on stated as code: we are
   filling this in because the NAME identifies the place, so if none of
   the name is in the answer, the answer came from an association and
   is exactly what must not be written. It costs some true positives —
   "See the Mona Lisa" will not resolve to the Louvre — and that is the

   MAKING THE GUESS ARRIVE SOONER

   Five levers, none of which changes what the feature will answer:

   1. **Warm the isolate at sign-in.** `warmGuess()`, the exact
      counterpart of `warmGeo()`, and the biggest single win here —
      `unfurl` imports the Anthropic SDK, which is the one thing in this
      app with a real cold start, and without this the FIRST guess of
      every session pays for it. The ping costs one 400 and no model
      call; what it buys is a booted isolate and an open TLS connection.
   2. **Ask while they are still typing, not on blur.** The round trip
      is the whole cost, and firing it at a pause in typing overlaps it
      with the rest of the sheet being filled in — the answer is
      frequently already there by the time they would have left the
      field. Still one call per *pause*, never one per keystroke: that
      is what GUESS_IDLE_MS buys, and it is why the original comment
      said "not on input".
   3. **Say that it is working.** The chip read "None" and the location
      sat empty for the whole round trip, so a guess that landed two
      seconds later looked like the app changing its mind rather than
      like an answer arriving. `guessPending()` marks the two controls
      while one is in flight — see .is-guessing in detail.css. It makes
      nothing faster and it is the half the user actually feels.
   4. **Remember the answers for the session.** Most names are asked
      about once, but the ones that repeat — a name retyped after a
      correction, the same activity added to two lists — return
      instantly and free. Negative answers are cached too, and they are
      the majority.
   5. **Never ask twice for the same name.** `_guessFor` already did
      this within one sheet; the cache extends it across sheets.

   ⚠️ AND WHEN THE MODEL CALL ITSELF FAILS, THE FUNCTION SAYS SO. A
   thrown call used to return an empty answer and log to the Supabase
   console, which nobody reads — and an empty answer is exactly what a
   name identifying no place returns, so a broken deploy was
   indistinguishable from the feature working normally. It returns an
   `error` string with it now; this file logs it and refuses to cache
   an answer carrying one.

   ⚠️ THE OTHER HALF OF THE LATENCY IS ON THE FUNCTION, and it is not a
   model call: when the model DOES name a place, `predictPlace()` then
   waits on public Nominatim before answering — so the difficulty, which
   was ready and has nothing to do with the geocode, is held behind it.
   That call is bounded by a timeout there rather than left open-ended;
   see GEOCODE in functions/unfurl/index.ts.
   ============================================================== */
/* 450ms, down from 650. The pause it has to sit behind is the one

   spends a model call on a prefix. */

   TEACHING THE RATING WHAT THIS PERSON MEANS

   The difficulty half of the guess used to be judged against nothing
   but a home address, so it read as an average person's life. Two
   things now ride along with the name, and they do different jobs:

     the PROFILE (me.js) says WHY — no car, tight budget, hikes every
       weekend. Context a list of examples cannot state.
     these EXAMPLES say WHAT — activities the user already has, with
       the tier they already carry, so the model can see where this
       person's lines actually fall.

   **The sample is balanced across the three tiers on purpose.** Taking
   the most recent N outright is the obvious build and it is the one
   that breaks the feature: somebody who has been adding weekend ideas
   all month would send twelve easy examples and nothing else, and a
   set of examples that only demonstrates one tier does not teach a
   scale — it teaches a lean. So it is up to DIFF_EX_PER_TIER from each
   tier that has anything, newest first, and a tier with nothing simply
   contributes nothing.

   It costs no round trip: the ratings are already in the in-memory
   activity cache, the same synchronous read the duplicate check and
   Home's composer make. A cold cache means no examples and the call is
   exactly what it was before.

       rating the user changed by hand is the only genuinely new
       information in the loop, and putting it at the head of its tier
       is what lets DIFF_EX_PER_TIER spend its slots on corrections
