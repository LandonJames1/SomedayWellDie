   FINDING WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE, FROM THE SAME FIELD

   People arrive at Home with one of two things in mind — "put this
   somewhere" and "where did I put that" — and the composer was only
   ever an answer to the first. Typing "kayak" into it was a way to
   create a second kayaking activity beside the one already there.

   So it answers both. **It never blocks the add**: this only draws a
   dropdown, Return still opens the plan-or-record chooser, and a query
   matching nothing shows nothing. That is the whole contract, and it is
   what lets the field keep its old job unchanged.

   Deliberately synchronous, against the in-memory cache — the same
   thing dupeGuard() reads. Scoring every activity on a keystroke is
   cheap; a network round trip per keystroke is not, and a spinner under
   a field you are typing into would be worse than no feature. A cold
   cache means nothing to search, and the dropdown simply stays shut.

   It is not a replacement for the Search screen (the bar button is
   still there): five rows under a composer, activities only, no
