   "THIS ACTIVITY IS AT HOME"

   A boolean on the activity, set only when its location was chosen

   WHY THIS IS NOT A TEXT MATCH. The obvious implementation is to find
   activities whose `location` equals the old home address and rewrite
   them. That is wrong, and wrong in the worst way this app has:
   silently. If Home is "Denver, Colorado" and the user separately
   searched for and picked Denver for a hike — because the hike is in
   Denver, not because they live there — then moving house to Austin
   would drag the hike to Austin too. Nothing on screen would say so.
   That is the same class of defect as the stale-coordinates bug the
   geoFor contract exists to close, so it is not worth trading a
   migration to avoid.

   The flag records *intent*, which text cannot. Picking Home means "my
   home, whatever that is"; picking a place that happens to be the same
   town means that town, permanently.

   Optional like everything else here — without the column, changing

   THE CACHE

   Two queries back the entire app: every collection, and every
   activity in them. Both are held here for the session, so switching
   tabs re-renders from memory instead of going back to the network —
   which is what made moving between screens feel like a page load.

   Rules, in order of importance:

   1. **Any local write must invalidate.** Every mutation site calls
      invalidateActivities() / invalidateCollections(). Miss one and the
      screen renders stale rows until something else happens to refetch.
   2. **In-flight requests are shared.** Home renders four sections from
      the same two fetches, and the old code let them race into four
      duplicate round trips. A pending promise is handed to every caller.
   3. **A failed request is never cached.** An error returns [] as it
      always did, but leaves the cache empty so the next call retries
      rather than pinning an empty list for the session.
   4. **fetchActivitiesFor() filters the shared cache** rather than
      issuing its own query. That is what makes entering a collection
      free — it used to fetch the same rows twice over, since
      renderDetail() and renderActivitiesList() each called it.

   The app is single-user and writes only from this client, so a
   session-length cache is safe. `revalidate()` covers the one case it
   is not: the same account open on another device. It is called when
   the app is foregrounded and when the network comes back.
   ============================================================== */
let _cCollections=null,_cActivities=null;
let _pCollections=null,_pActivities=null;

/* ==============================================================
   THE CACHE BELONGS TO ONE ACCOUNT

   This is a security boundary, not an optimisation, and it is here
   rather than in auth.js on purpose: the cache lives in this file, so
   the check that it is being handed to the right person has to live
   here too. Anything else relies on every present and future sign-in
   path remembering to clear it, and that is exactly what failed.

   WHAT WENT WRONG. Every cache in the app is per-account, but the only
   thing that ever cleared them was the Sign Out button. So any sign-in
   that happened afterwards in the same page load — a new sign-up, a
   different account, or a sign-in after the session had lapsed and
   onAuthStateChange had quietly shown the login screen — was served
   the previous account's rows out of memory. A brand-new account made
   it worse rather than better: it has no disk snapshot, so
   primeFromSnapshot() returned false, so showApp()'s `if(warm)`
   skipped revalidate(), so nothing ever refreshed it. The new account
   saw the old one's lists, activities, notes and photos for the whole
   session.

   It was a client-side leak — RLS still refused every write, and a
   reload cleared it — but the rows were on screen, which is the part
   that matters.

   THE FIX. The cache records whose rows it holds. Every entry point
   that can read or fill it calls this first, and a mismatch wipes
   everything rather than answering. Signing in as someone else can no
   longer show their predecessor's data even if some future code path
   forgets to reset anything at all.

   Note it deliberately does NOT touch the on-disk snapshot: that is
   already keyed by user id (see snapKey in offline.js), and a session
   lapsing on a train is not a reason to destroy someone's offline
   copy. Explicit sign-out still clears it.

   PATCHING THE CACHE INSTEAD OF DROPPING IT

   Every mutation used to end with invalidateActivities(), which meant
   the re-render that followed it went back to the network for the
   whole table — a full select over every activity, photos included,
   to reflect one row the client had just written and already knew the
   final shape of.

   applyOp() in js/offline.js has to compute the new row set anyway,
   for the on-disk snapshot. These take that same result and re-derive
   the in-memory cache from it, so a completion or an edit redraws
   from memory with no round trip at all.

   Two rules:

   1. Raw PostgREST rows in, exactly as the snapshot holds them, so
      mapActivity()/mapCollection() stay the only thing that knows
      column names. Handing these mapped rows would fork that.
   2. **A cold cache is left cold.** If nothing has been fetched yet
      there is nothing to keep in step, and priming it here would make
      cacheWarm() true off the back of a single write — telling every
      screen it can skip its spinner when the rows have never been
      loaded. Falling through to the invalidate is a no-op in that
      case, which is the correct answer.

   They were nonetheless costing two serialised round trips on **every
   single mutation** — a select to recount, an update to store it —
   both awaited before the screen was allowed to redraw. Completing one
   activity was five round trips end to end, three of which existed to
   maintain numbers nothing displays.

   So this no longer blocks. It returns immediately, does the work
   detached, and coalesces repeated calls for the same collection so
   ticking off five things in a row is one recount rather than five.
   Callers can keep awaiting it; there is just nothing to wait for.

   It also no longer calls invalidateCollections(). That was the fourth
   round trip: dropping the collections cache to reflect a column no
   screen reads forced the very next render to refetch the whole table.
