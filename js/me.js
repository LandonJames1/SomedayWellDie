   THE PROFILE PHOTO

   One image on the Users row, stored in the same `media` bucket as

   should not be one: a second bucket is a second set of storage
   policies to keep in step, for a single file per account.

   It degrades the way everything optional here does. Two things have

     - supabase/avatars.sql has been run (_avatarReady, answered as a
       side effect of the profile read above);
     - the media bucket exists (storageReady(), from media.js).

   Without the bucket the photo would have to be inlined as base64 the
   way an offline completion photo is - and unlike a completion photo
   this one is read back on EVERY message in a conversation, so a
   quarter-megabyte data URL on the Users row would be pulled down and
   re-parsed constantly. It is refused instead, which is the honest
   answer: this is the one place in the app where inline bytes are

   THE PROFILE ROW

   `Users` holds the display name and handle. It is read once per
   session — nothing in the app changes it after sign-up — and
   **created here if it is missing**, which is the part that matters.

   It used to be written inline by handleAuth() at the moment of
   sign-up. That only ever worked on a project with email confirmation
   switched off, because confirmation means signUp() returns no session
   and there is nothing signed in to write the row with. This project
   has confirmation on, so every account created since has had no
   profile: no name in the You tab, and nothing to identify them by on
   a shared list.

   So the name and username now travel as auth user metadata (see
   handleAuth) and the row is written on the first sign-in that has a
   real session. Running it on every sign-in rather than only after
   sign-up is deliberate — it also repairs the accounts that were
   created while this was broken.

   HOME

   One saved place, so the location field has an answer that needs no
   typing and no permission. It does two jobs:

     - the "Home" shortcut at the top of every location dropdown;
     - the bias point for place search when there is no geolocation
       fix, which is most of the time — see biasPoint() in location.js.
       That second job is quiet and is the more valuable one: it is
       what makes "coffee" mean the cafés near you rather than Coffee
       County, Georgia, without ever raising a permission prompt.

   STORAGE IS TWO-LAYERED, on purpose. The real home is three columns
   on `Users` (supabase/home.sql), so it follows the account to a new
   device. But the app has to work before that migration is run, and a
   missing column would otherwise take the whole profile query down
   with it — so the columns are read in their own query, a failure is
   noted once and tolerated, and localStorage carries the value on
   this device either way. Once the columns exist, a value saved
   locally is pushed up on the next load.

   The localStorage key is per-user. Every cache in this app is
   per-account and cleared by resetAccountState() (see ONE ACCOUNT AT
   A TIME in CLAUDE.md); a shared key would show the previous
   account's home address to the next person to sign in on the device.

   MOVING HOUSE

   Change your home address and every activity whose location IS home

   them one at a time after a move is exactly the chore nobody does —
   so they sit on the map at a house somebody else lives in.

   WHICH ACTIVITIES: the ones carrying `location_is_home`, set when
   their location was chosen with the Home shortcut. NOT the ones whose
   location text happens to equal the old address. See "THIS ACTIVITY
   IS AT HOME" in api.js for why that distinction is the whole design —
   text-matching would drag an activity that is genuinely in your old
   home town along with the ones that meant *home*, and say nothing.

   It is one dbUpdate against `location_is_home`, so it costs a single
   round trip however many rows match, and applyOp() patches the cache
   and the on-disk snapshot from the same match — no refetch.

   The user is TOLD, in a toast naming the count. This rewrites rows

/* ==============================================================
   DELETING THE ACCOUNT

   Every other destructive action in the app is one action sheet, and
   that is right for them: deleting a list costs you a list, and you
   still have the app. This one ends the account, takes every list,
   activity, photo and completion with it, and there is no undo and no
   support channel to ask for it back — so it is the one place the app
   makes you type something. An action sheet is dismissed by a stray
   tap on the scrim, which is not a bar this should clear.

   The sheet is explicit about the two things people get wrong:

   - **Lists you own that you have shared with other people are
     deleted too**, for them as well. There is nobody to hand ownership
     to without asking, and the alternative — silently keeping a dead
     account's list alive — is worse.
   - **Lists you joined are only left.** They are not yours to destroy
     and the other members keep them intact.

   The erase itself is supabase/functions/delete-account, because
   removing the auth user needs the service_role key. Without that
   function deployed this reports the failure rather than half-doing
   it — the local sign-out only happens after the server says it is
   done.
