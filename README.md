# Bucket List

A single-page web app for curating and tracking bucket-list collections, backed
by Supabase. It installs to a phone home screen as a PWA and is laid out for
screens from 320px up.

## Running it

There is no build step. Serve the folder with any static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Opening `index.html` directly from disk mostly works, but a real server is
recommended so Supabase auth and the map tiles behave normally. The service
worker only registers over `https://` or `localhost` — everything else still
works without it, just with no offline support.

## Installing it on an iPhone

The app has to be served over HTTPS from a real domain for iOS to offer the
install (localhost works for testing on the Mac, but not from the phone).
Once it is:

1. Open the site in **Safari** — Chrome and Firefox on iOS cannot install PWAs.
2. Tap the **Share** button, then **Add to Home Screen**, then **Add**.
3. Launch it from the home screen. It opens full screen with no browser chrome.

Signing in inside the app pops a one-time hint walking through those steps.
On Android/desktop Chrome an **Install** bar appears instead, driven by the
`beforeinstallprompt` event.

Once installed, the app shell (HTML/CSS/JS/icons/fonts/MapLibre) is cached and
launches offline. Your collections come from Supabase, so they need a
connection — an offline launch shows the UI with an "Offline" banner.

## Reminders (optional)

An activity can carry a reminder date — useful for things that need booking
ahead of the trip itself. It needs one column that isn't in the original
schema; run this once in the Supabase SQL editor to switch the feature on:

```sql
alter table "Activities" add column if not exists remind_at date;
```

Until you do, the app probes for the column and hides all reminder UI, so
nothing breaks either way.

Reminders reach you three ways, in order of reliability: a banner at the top of
Home (always), a notification when you next open the app on or after the date
(needs permission), and a real background push delivered on the day with the
app closed (needs the backend in `supabase/` deployed — see
`supabase/README.md`). On iOS the last one requires the app installed to the
home screen.

## Project structure

```
index.html            markup only — screens, sheets, and the <link>/<script> manifest
manifest.webmanifest  PWA metadata (name, icons, standalone display, theme color)
sw.js                 service worker — offline app shell + runtime caching
css/                  one stylesheet per concern
js/                   one script per concern
icons/                app icon PNGs, plus generate.py which draws them
supabase/             optional backend for reminders: schema, cron job, Edge Function
Supabase Setup/       CSV exports of the Collections / Activities / Users tables
_backup/              previous versions, kept for reference
```

## How it's put together

The interface has **iOS bones and its own voice** — UIKit structure (bottom tab
bar, collapsing large titles, bottom sheets, action sheets) wearing a warm
parchment/olive/terracotta palette with full dark mode. Three typefaces, each
with one job: Newsreader for display, the system stack for UI chrome, IBM Plex
Mono for the small-caps labels.

Four tabs, plus one screen that pushes on top of the second:

| Tab | Screen | What's there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Home** | `page-home` | Dashboard: progress ring, quick add, Up Next, recently accomplished. Both "See all" links push a full list — Up Next grouped by target band, Accomplished grouped by month. |
| **Lists** | `page-lists` | Every collection as a photo card. Tapping one pushes `page-detail`. |
| **Map** | `page-globalmap` | A full-screen map of everywhere you're going. |
| **You** | `page-me` | Profile, install, sign out. |

Three things are deliberately quick:

- **Adding, from anywhere.** Home has a composer that needs no list: type a
  name, press return, and pick which list it belongs to (skipped entirely if
  you only have one). Inside a list, the composer at the end of the activities
  files it straight away and keeps the caret for the next one.
- **Completing.** Tap the circle beside an activity. That's it — no dialog.
  Tapping again un-completes it, and *doesn't* discard the photos and notes
  from the earlier completion. Attaching those is a separate, optional step.
- **Staying signed in.** The session is restored on launch and the token is
  refreshed when the app comes back to the foreground, so you should only see
  the login screen after signing out. Note an installed PWA has its own storage
  on iOS — signing in in Safari and then installing means signing in once more.
- **Finding.** The Map tab is a WebGL globe. Zoomed out you get the Earth as a
  sphere; it eases into a flat map as you zoom in. The map fills the screen and
  its controls float on top, rather than sitting in a box on a page.

The primary **add** button floats at the bottom right, above the tab bar, on
every screen where adding makes sense — within thumb reach rather than in the
top corner.

### Stylesheets

Loaded in the order below; **order matters**.

| File | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| `base.css` | Design tokens: the three type faces, the warm palette (light + dark), the shadow scale, layout metrics, safe-area insets, the type scale, reset, keyframes. Re-theming the app is this one file. |
| `layout.css` | The app shell: navigation bar, collapsing large title, bottom tab bar, the page show/hide system. |
| `components.css` | Reusable iOS primitives: grouped lists, segmented controls, buttons, search field, badges, empty states. Check here before writing a new component. |
| `auth.css` | The signed-out sign-in / create-account screen. |
| `home.css` | The Home dashboard: progress ring, quick add, Up Next, the on-this-day and recently-accomplished shelves. |
| `photos.css` | The photo wall's grid. Everything else on that screen is borrowed from `home.css` and `components.css`. |
| `collections.css` | The Lists tab — collection photo cards. |
| `detail.css` | One collection: banner, activity rows, quick-add composer, grid cards, activity sheet. |
| `me.css` | The Me tab. |
| `modals.css` | Bottom sheets, action sheets, form controls, photo lightbox, toast. |
| `map.css` | Map containers, the sky gradient behind the globe, floating controls, pins, clusters, location autocomplete. |
| `bulk.css` | The "add many at once" sheet. |
| `pwa.css` | Install prompts, iOS Add-to-Home-Screen sheet, offline banner. |
| `responsive.css` | Small phones, and ≥700px where the app centres in a column. **Must load last.** |

### Scripts

These are plain (non-module) scripts, so they all share one global scope.
That is deliberate: the markup uses inline `onclick="..."` handlers, and those
can only reach functions that are global. Load order follows the dependency
chain below.

**Foundation**

| File | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| `config.js` | Supabase URL/key, the `sb` client, default cover images. |
| `state.js` | Mutable globals: current user, current tab/screen, filters, view mode, live map handles. |
| `utils.js` | `$`, `esc`, `fmtDate`, `dateInfo` (target-date urgency), image `compress`, `confetti`. |
| `icons.js` | The app's own inline-SVG icon set, and the `icon()` helper. |
| `api.js` | Every Supabase read/write. Row mappers translate snake_case columns to the camelCase shapes the UI uses. |

**Shell and shared UI**

| File | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| `auth.js` | Sign in / sign up / sign out and the auth screen. |
| `nav.js` | `nav()` — the single entry point for changing screens. Also the tab bar, the nav bar contents, the scroll-collapse behaviour, and the body scroll lock. |
| `modals.js` | Sheet open/close, action sheets (used for menus and destructive confirms), photo lightbox, toast. |

**Reusable form widgets**

| File | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| `links.js` | The URL chip input. |
| `location.js` | Debounced place search against OpenStreetMap Nominatim. |
| `photos.js` | Completion photo upload, compression, previews. |

**Screens and features**

| File | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| `home.js` | The Home dashboard, and the quick-add that files an activity into a chosen list. |
| `upnext.js` | The full Up Next screen, grouped by target band (this month, this year, next year…). |
| `done.js` | The full Accomplished screen, grouped by the month things were finished. |
| `photos.js` | Every photo and video you have ever attached, as one grid. Reached from Accomplished and from the You tab. |
| `reminders.js` | Reminder dates: the due banner on Home, and local notifications when the app is opened. |
| `collections.js` | The Lists tab plus create/edit/delete a collection. |
| `detail.js` | One collection: banner, filter, the activity list/grid/map switch, the composer. |
| `activities.js` | Quick add, one-tap complete, the full activity sheet, completion details, the ⋯ menu. |
| `me.js` | The Me tab. |
| `bulk.js` | The "add many at once" sheet. |
| `map.js` | MapLibre GL: the globe on the Map tab, the flat per-collection map, clustering and pins. |
| `pwa.js` | Registers the service worker; drives install prompts, offline banner, update toast. |
| `main.js` | Boot: paints the static icons, restores the session, shows the app or the auth screen. **Loads last.** |

`sw.js` is the exception to all of the above: it is a service worker, runs in
its own scope, shares none of these globals, and must stay at the project root.

## Adding a new screen

1. Add the markup as `<div class="page" id="page-yourpage">` in `index.html`.
2. Either add a tab button to `.tabbar` (and a `PAGE_TAB` entry plus a
   `selectTab()` case in `js/nav.js`), or make it a pushed screen with a back
   button in `updateNavbar()`.
3. Create `css/yourpage.css` and link it *before* `responsive.css`.
4. Create `js/yourpage.js` with a `renderYourPage()` function and add a
   `if(page==='yourpage') renderYourPage();` line to `nav()` in `js/nav.js`.
5. Add both new files to `SHELL_ASSETS` in `sw.js` and bump `CACHE_VERSION`,
   or they will not be available offline.

See `CLAUDE.md` for the detailed layout rules and the design-language notes.
