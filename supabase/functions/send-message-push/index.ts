/* ==============================================================
   send-message-push — a Web Push the moment a message is sent.

   ---- Why this is not a cron, and not a database trigger ----

   A reminder is "tell me on March 3rd": nothing happens on March 3rd,
   so something has to wake up and check the calendar. That is the ONLY
   reason send-reminders is scheduled, and it does not generalise. A
   message's event is the insert itself, so it is pushed immediately.

   The obvious shape is a trigger on `messages` calling this over
   pg_net. It is deliberately called from the client instead, right
   after the insert succeeds:

     - no pg_net, no pg_cron, no trigger to keep in step with the table;
     - the caller's JWT is right here, so membership can be verified
       against the *user*, not just asserted by the row;
     - a failure is visible to the sender rather than buried in
       Postgres logs.

   The tradeoff, stated plainly: a message that reaches the table by
   some other route does not push. In practice that is the offline
   queue replay in js/offline.js, which upserts directly — so a message
   written in a tunnel syncs silently. Accepted rather than fixed,
   because the alternative is the trigger and everything above.

   ---- What the client is NOT trusted for ----

   It sends a message id and nothing else. Every fact used to build the
   notification — the body, the sender, the collection, who is in it —
   is read back here with the service role. A caller cannot push
   arbitrary text to arbitrary people by lying in the body, which is
   the whole reason this is not "here is a payload, deliver it".

   Deploy:
     supabase functions deploy send-message-push

   Secrets (shared with send-reminders):
     VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY, VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY, VAPID_SUBJECT

   ⚠️ Never deploy this with --no-verify-jwt. Unlike send-reminders,
   which has its own CRON_SECRET as a second gate, the JWT IS the gate
   here — it is how the sender is identified at all.
