/* ==============================================================
   send-reminders — the daily sweep that actually delivers reminders.

   A web app cannot wake itself up, so the push has to originate from a
   server. This runs once a day (see cron.sql), finds every activity
   whose reminder date has arrived, and sends a Web Push to each device
   belonging to everybody who can see it.

   ---- Everybody, not just the owner ----

   This used to select `Collections!inner(user_id)` and send only to
   that one person. On a shared list that is the wrong answer and a
   quiet one: three people share a list, one of them sets a reminder to
   book the campsite, and the notification goes to whoever happens to
   own the list — possibly not even the person who set it. The other
   two are never told, and nothing anywhere says so.

   So the audience for an activity is now the collection's owner plus
   every row in `collection_members` for it. A reminder on a shared
   list is a reminder for the people sharing it.

   ---- Why deliveries are tracked in their own table ----

   `Activities.reminder_sent_at` is a single column, so the first
   successful send marked the reminder done for everyone. That is
   exactly wrong once there is more than one recipient: whoever the
   sweep reached first would silently consume the notification for the
   whole list. `reminder_deliveries` is keyed on
   (activity_id, user_id, remind_at) instead, so each person is tracked
   separately, and moving the date re-arms it for all of them without
   needing the trigger to clear anything.

   The old column is still written, purely so anything else looking at
   it keeps seeing what it expects. Nothing here reads it.
